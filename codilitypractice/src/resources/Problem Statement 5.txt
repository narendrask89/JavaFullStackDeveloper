A pointer is called a  linked list  if:
	1. it is an empty pointer (it is then called a terminator  or an empty list);
	or
	2. it points to a structure (called a node  or the head) that contains a value and a linked list (called the tail).
	
The length  of a list is defined as the total number of nodes it contains. In particular, an empty list has length 0.

For example, consider the following linked list:
  A -> B -> C -> D ->
  
  This list contains four nodes: A, B, C and D. Node D is the last node and its tail is the terminator. The length of this list is 4.
  
  Assume that the following declarations are given:
  class IntList {
  public int value;
  public IntList next;
}

Write a function:

class Solution { public int solution(IntList L); }

that, given a non-empty linked list L consisting of N nodes, returns its length.

For example, given list L shown in the example above, the function should return 4.

Assume that :

	1. N is an integer within the range [1..5000];
	2. list L does not have a cycle (each non-empty pointer points to a different structure).

In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment.
